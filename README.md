# Fern and Roby / Tektonics design mocks

HTML/CSS mocks of additional components for fernandroby.com.
Also, css and page mocks for new tektonics site.

Uses php for shared assets (header, footer, etc.) Samples css, js, and markup from live f/r site as the foundation.

## Fern and Roby

See tektonics.team-eight.com/content-blocks.php in a browser for a preview of the desired content blocks we're proposing to add to the f/r CMS. See ./assets/style.css for the required css to support these blocks. 

## Tektonics design mocks

After components are added to Fern and Roby and the CMS theme is duplicated to a dev environment for the new tektonics site, these mocks show the css and markup additions to update the theme to leverage the Tektonics brand. See ./assets/tektonics_style.css for the required css to support these blocks. Refer to ./partials/header.php and ./partials/footer.php for the markup changes for these components.
