                    <h2>Our efficient design process</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Eliminates</strong> overhead costs associated with engaging &amp; coordinating multiple engineering and manufacturing firms</li>
                        <li><strong>Leverages</strong> relationships with subcontractors</li>
                        <li><strong>Integrates</strong> materials, means, and methods knowledge gained through our interdisciplinary business model.</li>
                        <li><strong>Allows</strong> easy and fluid real-time changes to designs, e.g., we can walk out the door of the design studio and into the shop to interface with the projects in process.</li>
                        <li><strong>Anticipates</strong> business / planning consequences &amp; benefits in design stages pertaining to branding, marketing, manufacturing, and fulfillment issues.</li>
                        <li><strong>Maintains</strong> a culture of good stewardship of our clientsâ€™ Intellectual Property and the manufacturing standards of their products in-house &amp; out-sourced.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reduces</strong> costly production problems that typically happen as a result of poor communication and maintenance of documentation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Results</strong> in reduction of time loss due to coordination of multiple contractors</li>
