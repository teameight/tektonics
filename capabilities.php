                    <h3>INDUSTRIAL DESIGN</h3>
                    <p>Our CAD-CAM process entails digital solid modeling and advanced machining for rapid prototyping. Because our design studio is located within our manufacturing facility we can efficiently develop our concepts into products in real time. We test these proofs of concept against real world techniques, budgets, and schedules to ensure realization, and offer traditional and advanced manufacturing capabilities to help bring the product to market for our clientele.</p>

                    <h3>MANUFACTURING</h3>
                    <p>Combining our advanced manufacturing technologies with traditional craft, our team can produce anything from precision-machined hardware to sculptural works created with a handcrafted touch.</p>
                    <p>Our full-service fabrication shop provides forming, welding, laser marking and finishing of metal.</p>
                    <p>Our woodshop gives us the ability to deliver formwork, milling, shaping, and veneering, and create custom cabinetry, casework, and furniture.</p>

                    <h3>PROTOTYPING</h3>
                    <p>Our CNC machine shop is capable of large and small runs of machined parts as well as prototypes.Through a close partnership with OK Foundry, a local family-owned business, we have access to the cost efficiencies of the casting process. We design and build patterns (foundry tooling) and provide machining services to the foundry, which in turn has informed our own product development.</p>
